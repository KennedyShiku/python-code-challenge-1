# Code Challenge Week 1

In this week's code challenge I made Python scripts for various tasks. Each script has its own functionality, described below.

## `time_converter.py`

### Description:
The `time_converter.py` Python script converts a given time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format. It takes input for hour, minute, and period (am/pm) and returns the time in the 24-hour format. The script ensures proper formatting, including zero-padding for single-digit hours and minutes.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt by typing `python time_converter.py`.
3. Enter the hour, minute, and period (am/pm) when prompted.
4. The script will display the time in the 24-hour format.

## `consonant_value.py`

### Description:
The `consonant_value.py` Python script calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given input string. It uses a predefined mapping of consonants to values, and it excludes vowels from the calculations. The script displays the highest calculated value.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt by typing `python consonant_value.py`.
3. Enter the input string when prompted.
4. The script will calculate and display the highest value of consonant substrings in the input string.

## `positive_numbers.py`

### Description:
The `positive_numbers.py` Python script checks if exactly two out of three given numbers are positive. It returns `True` if exactly two numbers are positive, and `False` otherwise.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt by typing `python positive_numbers.py`.
3. Enter the three numbers when prompted.
4. The script will display `True` if exactly two numbers are positive, and `False` otherwise.
